The tests that need to be carried out are validation and authorization tests on the
login screen (can they inject anything, if they enter the right username and password
are they accepted, if any inputs are wrong will it decline, etc.). We will also need to
run validation tests on the creation of items, the update of item quantities, and the
deletion of items (does it make/update/delete the correct item, will it prevent any
copies of items, can it detect injections, etc.).
