There are a few key security controls that are being implemented into the inventory
managment program. First is the implementation of requiring a username and passoword
in order to access the database and its contents. These two pieces of data will be
stored, with the password being encrypted using SHA-456 and stored in a shadow file.
The database itself will also be encrypted, using a key that is based around each
user's hashed passwords, allowing them to decrypt the database data once confirmed to
be a valid user and preventing anyone else from accessing and parsing its contents.

Once the user is signed in and the data is decrypted, the user can create a new item
to add to the inventory, delete an existing item, and update an item's quantity.
With this ability comes scrubbign and sanitization, particularly on the Part Number
and Part Name to prevent any injections. Quantity updates are only done through
selecting specific quantities from a dropdown box. Any decision to
create/update/delete comes with multiple confirmations about data in order to prevent
any accidents. Particularly with deletions, the user will be required to enter the
part number for specificity and further confirmation. Lastly, the user will be able
to search for specific parts based on their associated info. This will also be using
scrubbing and sanitization, in order to prevent any injections.
