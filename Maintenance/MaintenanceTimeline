In reality, the timeline for this maintenance is extremely short. Since we will
not be supporting the application after the 3 weeks, the timeline is really what
the customer would be willing to pay. But if we were to continue supporting this
for a time, such as a couple years, the timeline would go something like this:
for 2 weeks would be the inplementation and testing of encryption on the database
and finishing the scrubbing for inputs. Then would be the backup files and reports,
which would take an additional 2 weeks. After that would be the addition of multiple
users and the changing of passwords, another 3 weeks. After that, general maintenance
such as changing of encryption keys and hashes would be monthly, for about 2-3 years
or until the application is no longer used.
