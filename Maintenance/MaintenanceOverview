There are a few spots that require maintenance to be carried out on the Inventory
Database Application. The biggest is the addition of encryption on the database
itself, as it wasnâ€™t able to be implemented within our timeframe. This comes with
its own maintenance, such as changing the encryption key and hashes every so often
to prevent any potential security breaches. There is also the implementation of
backup files and weekly reports, further increasing security and displaying all the
changes made to the system. There is also the option of implementation of multiple
users, allowing more people to use the database as needed, which would require
checks to make sure any unauthorized users are found and reported to any
administrators. Users should take care in protecting their passwords, changing them
every so often to maximize security, requiring a change password option. Other than
these stated maintenance options, the system requires relatively few maintenance
checks.
